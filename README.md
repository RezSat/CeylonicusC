# Ceylonicus

It's the first sinhala programming language, and was written in python for prototyping, this is the C implementation of the language. It was originally interpreted and use the python interpreter for the execution, which you can see in [https://github.com/RezSat/Ceylonicus](https://github.com/RezSat/Ceylonicus)

Key changes in this implementation is that, the language is no longer interpreted instead it is fully compiled.
